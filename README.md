# CPRG 218 Intermediate Web Communications Responsive Design Introduction
## Module 4 - Building Responsive Websites
### Week 4
These are the starter HTML files for the week 4 introduction to responsive design.

Students are expected to fork this repository, and work along with the demo as they explore media queries and responsive design. Github Pages can be used to allow the project to be viewed on the web using multiple different devices - including a mobile device.

**The Github pages URL is _https://username*.github.io/repositoryname/_. If your repository contains a page named _index.html_ it will show up when you visit that repository directly, as that is the page that our browser understands to be the homepage. If you wish to visit another page within this repository, add its name after the slash at the end of the URL.**
